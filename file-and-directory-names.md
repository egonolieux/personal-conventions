# File and directory name conventions

Only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z), `-`, `_` and `.` are allowed. The `-` character must be used as a replacement for the ` ` character. In general, names are recommended to be all lowercase, but depending on the context, uppercase characters can be used as well.

Work in progress...
