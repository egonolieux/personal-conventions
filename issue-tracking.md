# Issue tracking

## Title and description

- Do not add a description if the title is self explanatory.
- Do not end the title with a period.
- Prefer writing short titles for better readability.
- Prefer writing the title in the imperative mood. If not possible, use a descriptive sentence instead.
- Use Markdown for both titles and descriptions.
- Use proper capitalization.
