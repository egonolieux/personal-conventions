# Conventions to be established

This document contains various conventions that need to be established, but still require more research.

- JavaScript: Finish `.eslintrc.js` conventions. Also: New line before break and continue?
- Front end: Review the naming of classes/IDs.
- Front end: Review the use of `px` vs `rem`.
- Front end: Use `ul` elements where possible (list groups?). Maybe establish a convention?
- General: Convention regarding single use variables? Currently no single use, might be harder for step debugging and readability though.
- General: Establish a new convention regarding the precedence of `==` over `!=`.
- JavaScript: Check the usage of `Object.hasOwnProperty()` vs `typeof x === 'undefined'` vs `in`. Maybe also use the new `Object.hasOwn()`?
- JavaScript: Event listener order.
- Less: Put certain breakpoints of page components in separate variables.
- Naming: Boolean conventions don't work, for example `shareModalButton`. Maybe use a `Var` suffix? Also see the *card wishlist toggle* button.
- Naming: Check the use of `or`/`and` in variable/function names (tuple name conventions in general?). Probably not for tuples because of `byUserIdAndCardId` for example?
- Naming: Some functions/methods should not be suffixed by `By<SomeArguments>`. Establish a new convention?
- PHP: Use string interpolation or `sprintf()` instead of concatenation.
- Twig: Better differentiate between `span` and `div`?
- Twig: Establish new convention regarding how classes and other attributes must be ordered.
- Typgraphy: *do not* vs *don't*.
- Typgraphy: *for* vs *of*.
- Typgraphy: *one* vs *1*.
- Typgraphy: Use a comma after *because*, *and*, *or*, etc?
